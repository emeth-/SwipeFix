Tools for Sales Managers have vastly outpaced tools for Sales Reps.

There are a ton of advanced reporting and analytics packages on the market that give sales managers the ability to peer into their sales reps stats and data.

With this newfound visibility for managers, Sales Reps are getting dressed down in Sales Meetings left and right, dinged for various metrics and embarrassing bad data.

We aim to change that.

Our tool gives the sales reps both visibility into the things likely to catch their manager's eyes, and the ability to rapidly fix things with small gaps of spare time throughout the day - like when standing in line at a grocery store.

Introducing... SwipeFix.
